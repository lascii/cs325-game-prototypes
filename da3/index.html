<h2>Treasure Map</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<ul>
<li>The player has to complete 2 block-pushing puzzles and obtain 2 items in order to get the treasure.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
<li>The player needs to push the blocks in a certain way to get to the end.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul>
<li>I learned how to create various interactions and how to make objects collide. I also learned how to combine 2 scenes on the screen at the same time. Getting the objects to collide was the hardest part and they still sometimes go through each other if the player pushes too much on them.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>Used the code from my previous game just to set up the 2D environment, but everything else is new.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Borrowed code from <a href="https://labs.phaser.io/edit.html?src=src%5Cscenes%5Cui%20scene%20es6.js">here</a> to create multiple scenes</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<ul>
<li>Goal is to obtain a treasure map and find the buried treasure.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<ul>
<li>Pirate</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<ul>
<li>input: direct</li>
<li>randomness: deterministic</li>
<li>play style: explorer</li>
<li>genre: puzzle</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<ul>
<li>Moving around a 2D environment, collision of objects, sequence of events</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<ul>
<li>Have fun exploring the world and figuring out what to do with limited guidance.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>
<li>Player uses WASD to move. Inside the puzzle rooms, the player is supposed to push the blocks so that they can get to the end. Other keys are used and explained in the game.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul>
<li>Figuring out which blocks to move.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<ul>
<li>Game is set on an island. The character is told about a pirate's treasure map inside a cave.</li>
</ul>
</li>
