What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<ul>
<li>A sense of challenge as more frogs are added.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype.
